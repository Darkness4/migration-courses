# TP3: RecyclerView

## üìù Goal

The goal is to display a list of book using a `RecyclerView`.

Preparatory work:
- Copy `Book`, `Bookshelf`, `MainActivity` and `CreateBookActivity` of the previous TP 
- Add an instance of `Bookshelf` in `MainActivity` to be able to store multiples books created using `CreateBookActivity`

RecyclerView implementation: 
- Create a `row_book` XML file in `res/layout`. In this file, create a layout to display content of a book (title, author, date)
- Create a `BookViewHolder` class and implement it as it's done in the course
- Create a `BookAdapter` class and implement it as it's done in the course (the constructor should deal with a `ArrayList<Book>`)
- Add a `<recycler-view>` in the layout of the `MainActivity`
- Link the RecyclerView and the BookAdapter in the `MainActivity`

‚ö†Ô∏è The list must be updated each time a book is created.

## üöÄ Getting Started

 - Start Android Studio
 - Select `Open an existing Android Studio project` and pick this directory

That's it! You can code!

## üõ∞ Extra:

- Display the books in a grid instead of a list
- Add a button on each book of the list to be able to delete them
